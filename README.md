===========================
PagePlusBalance retrieves your balance from PagePlusCellular.com, currently for android phones.

Features:
----------------------
1. Gets your balance directly from PagePlusCellular.com,
saving bandwidth by making fewer requests than a browser
could and not downloading any javascript, css, or images
that a browser would.
2. Optionally, over mobile data, will send your details
to a service on my server that uses the same code to grab
your balance from Page Plus as the android app and sending
you back only the data you want as plain text, saving you
a substantial amount of bandwidth.
3. Now supports getting your balance by automatically
sending a text of BAL to 7243, and parsing the response.
4. Stores your balance on your phone along with the last
time you refreshed it.
5. Open source under GNU/AGPL!

How to comply with License:
----------------------
Basically, the AGPL requires that if you distribute the code,
or if you host the application where the public can access it,
such as a public server, then you must provide the source code
along with your modifications as a download on that page.
This is to promote development of the program and share
code with everyone to improve it.  If you have any questions,
contact me at android@moparisthebest.org.  If you use the code,
I'd love to know, so drop me a line if you would.
